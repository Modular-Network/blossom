=========================

This demo will only be short lived and has limited functionality, please read all of these instructions to get max benefit. This repo and app folder will close in 24 hours. What this will do:   

* Let you create a wallet
* Let you launch a token and crowdsale on rinkeby
* Give you an idea of the functions we're going for with the MVP
* Show you how awesome this team is, please take moment and congratulate:

   - ben@modular.network
   - joshua@modular.network
   - marcio@modular.network
   - pires@modular.network   

   These guys killed it to break from production development and get this from design to done in a week and a half.   

What this won't do:

* Show you the actual UI, the UI used here is a template UI and in no way close to what the final product will look like. Aqeel has come on board to give us a professional polish on everything from branding Blossom to the UX/UI development along with Ben.
* Send tokens, don't want to get too dangerous with this until it's ready.
